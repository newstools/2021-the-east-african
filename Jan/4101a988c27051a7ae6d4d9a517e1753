 Streaming service Showmax is expanding its investment in Africa with its first original Kenyan series and second co-production with global broadcaster CANAL+ to stream Crime and Justice. Showmax and CANAL+ have begun production on the show, a gritty police procedural and legal drama set in Nairobi. Crime and Justice features a cast that includes Sarah Hassan (Plan B, How to Find a Husband) and Alfred Munyua (Poacher, The First Grader, Sense8). They star as Makena and Silas, two detectives at the heart of the topical show that follows one ripped-from-the-headlines case per episode all the way through to the courtroom verdict. “When I first read the script, I loved the delivery and realness of Silas as a character. It’s not exaggerated and he’s no Rambo hero; he just tackles his cases the normal way. I found a very real edge with this script, and I hope I’ll do justice to the role,” Munyua says. Hassan says she is looking forward to playing a detective. “I’ve never played anything like Makena before. It’s exciting to get a character that makes me grow as an actor.” Hassan and Munyua are joined by Maqbul Mohammed (Varshita, Auntie Boss) as DCI Boss Kebo, Paul Ogola (Sense8, Kati Kati) as Prosecutor Sokoro, and Brian Ogola (Lusala, Disconnect) as Caleb, the resident pathologist. Stage and screen legend John Sibi-Okumu (The Constant Gardener, The First Grader), Muhugu Theuri (Pillow Talk, Pieces of Us), Brian Abajah (Sincerely Daisy), Martin Githinji (The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind) and Justin Mirichii (Rafiki, Watu Wote) appear in guest roles. Production includes an all-star Kenyan crew including Maureen Wanjiku, Walter Odhiambo and cinematographer Sammy Maina.
