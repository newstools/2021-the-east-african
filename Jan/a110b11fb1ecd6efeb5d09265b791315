The Ugandan electoral commission has declared incumbent President Yoweri Museveni winner of the January 14 election with 58.64 per cent of the votes cast. His closest rival Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, came second with 34.83 per cent of the votes. Vote counting ended Saturday, with results from the Electoral Commission (EC) confirming the victory by Mr Museveni, 76, who is now set to begin his sixth term in office. Just over 10 million people cast their votes out of the 18.1 million registered voters. Justice Byabakama said Mr Museveni, who ran on a National Resistance Movement (NRM) ticket won with 5,851,037 votes while Mr Kyagulanyi had 3,475,298 votes. Bobi Wine had as early as Friday dismissed the election results as the Electoral Commission announced provisional numbers. He claimed there were malpractices during voting and assured his supporters of victory.
