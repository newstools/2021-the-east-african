The Ugandan government, through its communications agency, on Wednesday ordered service providers to halt internet access just hours before voting was to begin. The move effectively means that Ugandans will cast their ballots on Thursday amidst an internet blackout. On Tuesday evening, President Yoweri Museveni confirmed the shutdown of all social media platforms ahead of the Thursday election. The country is set to commence voting in an exercise that will see President Yoweri Museveni, 76, defend his seat from several presidential contenders including pop star cum politician Bobi Wine, 38. The election also follows a bloody campaign period characterised by State repression aimed at opposition candidates. "Information coming in is that the regime in Uganda is going to order for a complete shutdown of the internet in a short while. No matter what they do, the world is watching," Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said on Wednesday evening. Earlier on Wednesday, the United States Ambassador to the country announced that America had cancelled its decision to observe the election after the country’s electoral commission failed to accredit its observers. “It is with profound disappointment that I announce US Mission in Uganda’s decision to cancel our diplomatic observation of Uganda’s January 14 elections due to the decision by the Electoral Commission of Uganda to deny more than 75 per cent of the US election observer accreditations requested,” Amb Natalie Brown said in a statement. 11 candidates are running for the country's top seat in this year's poll.
