 Hong Kong's clothing retailer Giordano has opened its third store in Nairobi to capitalise on the growing Kenyan luxury-goods consumer market. The franchise store at the Two Rivers Mall on Kiambu Road follows the successful opening of two earlier outlets last year at the Garden City Mall on Thika Road and the Junction Mall on Ngong Road. Giordano overseas market development manager Hoying Lee said the fashion retailer sees great potential in the Kenyan market and could target more store openings. “We are grateful to our franchise partner for their dedication, support and belief in Giordano," said Ms Hoying, adding that "we are confident in the Kenyan market, and look forward to further developing our business." Established in 1981, Giordano has over 2,100 stores and counters across Asia, Australia, and the Middle East dealing in men’s, women’s and children’s luxury apparel. Global luxury brands have been making inroads into Kenya as they look to escape a gloomy landscape in the West by heading to new emerging markets where demand is growing fast. The spending largesse of Kenya's fast burgeoning middle class is also spurring luxury brands to double down on the Kenyan market - embracing e-commerce and pushing ahead with store openings. Driven by well-heeled Kenyan consumers forsaking their usual overseas trips to places like Milan and Paris as well as the pent-up demand that built during Covid-19 lockdown, spending on luxury goods is tipped to surge according to fashion industry insiders.
