Mozambican President Filipe Jocanto Nyusi is in Tanzania for a one-day official visit He was scheduled to visit the country last year, but the visit was postponed. The Mozambique leader was received by his host President John Magufuli in the president’s hometown of Chato in Geita region, northwestern Tanzania on Monday. Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Paramagamba Kabudi, said Mr Nyusi's visit was “a brotherhood visit”. “He was supposed to have come last year but, due to several reasons, he couldn't. This is an appropriate time for the visit - especially after the conclusion of the 2020 General Election,” Prof Kabudi said. According to the minister, bilateral relations between the two countries on key areas of economy, politics and social affairs topped the agenda of the talks between the two presidents. Despite the challenges the two countries faced last year, including the global coronavirus pandemic, they “will discuss how to strengthen and improve economic ties,” Prof Kabudi said. “Tanzania and Mozambique have historic relations. The Makuwa tribe found in Southern Tanzania is also found in Mozambique. The two countries also collectively shed their blood during the liberation struggles for Mozambique.”
