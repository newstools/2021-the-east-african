In August last year, President Salva Kiir ordered his country's aviation authorities to promptly investigate a plane crash that left eight people dead, according to South Sudan’s Red Cross. The order came after a chartered plane belonging to South West Aviation Company crashed shortly after taking off from Juba International Airport. South Link aircraft in July last year crashed in defunct Fangak State in Greater Jonglei State while carrying humanitarian staff. There was no death case recorded in the incident. Also In September 2018, South West Aviation Company’s plane crashed in Yirol Town of Lakes State killing over 20 people including a bishop and other government officials. *Story updated
